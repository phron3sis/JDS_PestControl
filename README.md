## **Why This Script Exists**

Most Pest Control bots run to portals, get stuck, or leech points while the Knight dies over and over.
**This script doesn’t do any of that.**

JDS Pest Control was built for one job:

### **➡ Keep the Knight alive and farm points with zero effort.**

Every game.
All day.
Every combat style.

If you want a script that just **gets you points**, reliably, without baby-sitting it — you're in the right place.

# **💎 What Makes JDS Pest Control Different**

## **✔ Designed Specifically for Defender Role**

It does the only strategy that gives:

* The safest gameplay
* The highest success rate
* The least suspicion
* The easiest antiban pattern to maintain

You stay at the Knight and automatically clear Shifters as soon as they appear.
No wandering.
No portal chasing.
No script confusion.

Just smooth, predictable points.

---

## **✔ Real Shifter Recognition (Not Guesswork)**

This script doesn’t “click purple dots.”
It uses a unique **two-color detection system** to positively identify Shifters before attacking.

What this means for you:

* Far fewer misclicks
* Clear, confident targeting
* Reliable combat even with 20+ players on screen
* Consistent behavior that looks human

---

## **✔ Human-Like Combat Timing**

It doesn’t spam-click.
It doesn’t attack twice per tick.
It doesn’t behave mechanically.

Instead, the script:

* Waits for XP drops
* Adjusts timing automatically
* Mimics real player hesitation
* Slows or speeds up based on “human-style variation”

To other players, it looks like someone who knows how to play Pest Control well.

---

## **✔ Automatic Boat Tier Selection**

Your combat level decides your boat:

* **40+** → Novice
* **70+** → Intermediate
* **100+** → Veteran

Everything is handled automatically.

---

## **✔ Smart Plank Behavior**

It crosses the plank safely (and retries if needed) without getting stuck, confused, or walking loops.

---

## **✔ Clean On-Screen HUD**

The HUD shows you:

* Runtime
* State
* Total wins
* Wins/hr
* Points/hr
* Total XP
* XP/hr
* Next break timer

Plus a custom spider icon on the panel.

Looks good. Works better.

# **⚙️ How It Plays**

### **1. Gets you into the correct boat**

### **2. Crosses the plank**

### **3. Walks to the Knight**

### **4. Identifies real Shifters**

### **5. Attacks automatically**

### **6. Tracks wins and points**

### **7. Repeats forever with antiban built-in**

You don’t touch anything.
You don’t need to guide it.
Just start it and let it run.

# **🛡 Anti-Ban Philosophy**

Good antiban isn’t random; it’s **consistent, human-like rhythm**.

This script uses:

* Realistic mouse movement patterns
* Natural idle time
* XP-based combat timing
* Camera adjustments
* Movement bias based on your account profile

The result is a style of play that is stable, believable, and avoids risky behavior that cheaper scripts love to do.

---

# **📈 Performance Expectation**

* Defend the Knight confidently
* Earn points every single game
* Scale XP/hr depending on your gear & stats
* Stay inside a safe, human-looking play style

This is not a portal-chasing bot.
It’s a **point farming machine.**
